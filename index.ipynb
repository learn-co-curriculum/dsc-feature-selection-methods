    "# Feature Selection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous section, you learned about many different ways to create features to model more complex relationships. However, you also saw that this can be problematic at times. For example, if you include interaction terms between all of your existing features and higher order polynomial functions, you will no doubt have an issue with overfitting to noise. In this lesson, you'll learn about the different techniques you can use to only use features that are most relevant to your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use feature selection to obtain the optimal subset of features in a dataset \n",
    "- Identify when it is appropriate to use certain methods of feature selection \n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is the process by which you select a subset of features relevant for model construction. Feature saelection comes with several benefits, the most obvious being the improvement in performance of a machine learning algorithm. Other benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decrease in computational complexity: As the number of features is reduced in a model, the easier it will be to compute the parameters of your model. It will also mean a decrease in the amount of data storage required to maintain the features of your model \n",
    "* Understanding your data: In the process of feature selection, you will gain more understanding of how features relate to one another \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the different types of feature selection approaches and their advantages/disadvantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Like many things in data science, there is no clear and easy answer for deciding which features to include in a model. There are, however, different strategies you can use to process features in an efficient way: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain knowledge\n",
    "* Wrapper methods\n",
    "* Filter methods\n",
    "* Embedded methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Domain knowledge   \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects when determining important features is the knowledge of the specific domain related to your dataset. This might mean reading past research papers that have explored similar topics or asking key stakeholders to determine what they believe the most important factors are for predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Wrapper methods   \n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapper methods determine the optimal subset of features using different combinations of features to train models and then calculating performance. Every subset is used to train models and then evaluated on a test set. As you might imagine, wrapper methods can end up being very computationally intensive, however, they are highly effective in determining the optimal subset. Because wrapper methods are so time-consuming, it becomes challenging to use them with large feature sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"./images/new_wrapper.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a wrapper method in linear regression is **Recursive Feature Elimination**, which starts with all features included in a model and removes them one by one. After the model has had a feature removed, whichever subset of features resulted in the least statistically significant deterioration of the model fit will indicate which omitted feature is the least useful for prediction. The opposite of this process is **Forward Selection**, which undergoes the same process in reverse. It begins with a single feature and continues to add the one feature at a time that improves model performance the most. "

    "#### Filter methods   \n",
    "Filter methods are feature selection methods carried out as a pre-processing step before even running a model. Filter methods work by observing characteristics of how variables are related to one another. Depending on the model that is being used, different metrics are used to determine which features will get eliminated and which will remain. Typically, filter methods will return a \"feature ranking\" that will tell you how features are ordered in relation to one another. They will remove the variables that are considered redundant. It's up to the Data Scientist to determine the cut-off point at which they will keep the top $n$ features, and this $$ is usually determined through cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src= \"./images/new_filter.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the linear regression context, a common filter method is to eliminate features that are highly correlated with one another. Another method is to use a variance threshold. This sets some threshold of required variance among features in order to include them in a model. The thought process behind this is that if variables do not have a high variance, they will not change much and will therefore not have much impact on our dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Embedded methods \n",
    "\n",
    "Embedded methods are feature selection methods that are included within the actual formulation of your machine learning algorithm. The most common kind of embedded method is regularization, in particular Lasso, because it has the capability of reducing your set of features automatically.\n",

    "Now, we're going to review the process behind performing feature selection with a dataset pertaining to diabetes. The dataset contains the independent variables age, sex, body mass index, blood pressure, and 6 different blood serum measurements. The target variable represents a quantitative measurement progression of diabetes from one year after a baseline observation. With feature selection, our goal is to find a model that is able to maintain high accuracy while not overfitting to noise."
